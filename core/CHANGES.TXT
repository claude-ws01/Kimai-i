=== v0.10.0-b1 ======= 2015-07-25  ============ db revision 2000 =======================================================

Notes: This jump to v0.10.0 db revision 2000, is my major overhaul of original Kimia v0.9.3rc1. There is still work to
do, but from what I have revised, the core is functionnal.  Here a short and incomplete list of what I have done.

- improvement: removed all references to 'server_conn', and 'pdo', as there are NO pdo processing in Kimai.
- improvement: removed 'server_type', unused.
- improvement: removed abstract mysql class, simply unnecessary with no real gain.
- improvement: added all default preferences for new users in global config.
- improvement: removed one unnecessary database locks ( no need when not multi table updates, even less when only select)
- improvement: upgraded the db transaction handling method
- feature: preferences is now unified, for customer or user. Methods, Variables & db. User/Customer's prefs are both in
    the preference table.
- improvement: user_id & customer_id are now both checked for uniqness against preference table.
- features: customer can now set their own preferences.
- improvement: massive revision of global variables (some people should learn about why and how to use
    global/protected/private variables/method, and abstract)
    ~ GLOBALS: kga, database, view (zend framework), translation.
    ~ important $kga arrays:
        * any       (id, type, common to user & customer)
        * conf      (copy of configuration table)
        * customer  (when logged-in, customer's data)
        * lang      (locale translation)
        * pref      (preferences of both user/customer)
        * status    (copy of status table)
        * user      (when logged-in, user's data)
- improvement: handling of grid header in timesheet,expenses,export...
- improvement: PSR standardizing of all namings of tables and rows (excluding role related)
- improvement: PSR standardizing of "role" related row names in db-tables. no more "-", instead "_".
- improvement: status table now loaded in translation array, what ever translation exist will
    override status name from db... Simply put, change language and status names
    will follow. If no translation exist (because it's new status) then the status
    name from the db will be shown.
- improvement: debug panel: deactivate log updates while panel not active (avoid useless http requests)
- feature: extention's css & grfx folders can now be included in a skin folder, then modified to change the appearance
    and it will override the extensions default.
- bugfix: bottom filters not always displaying when navigating from one tab to another.
- feature: new *root* privilege gives access to everything, no matter if user has privileges or
    not. Glogal role "edit admin panel advanced settings" is *root*.
- improvement: page generators for timesheet, expense & export are now shorter by half, code efficient
    and easier to read.
- improvement: lots more popup 'tips' on most action links (icons, headers...), improving understanding of
    what things do.
- bugfix: multiple table update without transaction (in project)... added.
- bugfix: transaction now support multiple level. A method starts a db-transaction and calls another method that also
    starts a db-transaction while already inside the previous transaction. Now ok.
- improvement: force closing database at end of php process, giving a chance to check if there were incompleted
    db-transaction (ie. commit was not called, or some issue prevented the end of the transaction) and log a
    correponding warning.
- improvement: floating windows now always centered.
- improvement: added money symbol besides money field labels, clarifying what's suppose to go in there.
- improvement: added "processing" visual feedback, to let know the user his request is being processed. Not very
    noticable on fast server, but on slower local server.
- improvement: corrected some ambiguous German traductions (tracking_number -> order/ref code, effort -> (still
    figuring out this one)(I guess it is close to expenditure, costs, additional expenses...)
- change: minimum width down from 970px to 900px.
- optimization: removed many db-get-user-groups of current user, as groups is already loaded in $kga.
- improvement: top page displays better and resize flows better
- bugfix: added missing message var initialization for adding user, project, customers... in admin.
- improvement: on page load, now shows the user as filtered. Before you would be wondering why all the timesheets were
    not shown.
- optimization: - reduction of the number of http request from 100~110 to 50~60.
                - reduction of transfers from 428KB to 277KB (on the first fetch)
                - reduction of transfers on subsequent fetch as well, by a minimal 10KB
