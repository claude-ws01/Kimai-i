Kimai-i Time Tracking
====================================

(This is NOT the repository of The original Kimai)

It is a branch from original Kimai v0.9.3rc1.
It includes
 - Implementation of mysqli
 - Revision of rendering of Timesheet, Export, Expenses, Invoice (header & content alignments)
 - New standard skin (almost like the original but less flashy)
 - Many bug corrections
 - Revised & cleaned language files (only EN and FR)
 - Corrected all encountered "strict standards" PHP 5.5 warnings.
 - Code revision & optimisation... now closer to PSR1.
 - ... and many more improvements.

Enjoy

Claude.
