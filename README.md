Kimai Time Tracking - mysqli version
====================================

This is NOT the repository of Kimai.

It is a branch from original Kimai v0.9.3rc1.
It includes
 - implementation of mysqli
 - revision of rendering of Timesheet, Export, Expenses, Invoice (header & content alignments)
 - new skin (almost like the original but less flashy)
 - few bug corrections
 - revised & cleaned language files (only EN and FR)
 - corrected all "strict standards" PHP 5.5 I have encountered.

I did not pull requested into the original version because I did too many reformating of the PHP & Js files
and it would be a bit too much for the Kimai Team. (by reformating undertand, layout to PSR standards, sorting of
functions (methods) in some of the biggest PHP files. But the Naming is still original)

Still I want to make it available to the Kimai Team (or anybody else) that may be interested in using it.

Kind regards,

Claude.
